<div class="header"><h1>About the Hunger Games Simulator</h1></div>
<div style="position: relative; top: 150px;">
  <p>The Hunger Games Simulator is an entirely client-side, in-browser implementation of the Hunger Games (by Suzanne Collins), modified to add phrases and scenarios relevant to High Tech life and inside jokes. The code is written entirely in pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript and is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/air-wreck/woag-wiag-wiag">Github</a>.</p>
  <p>This specific simulator is actually a fork by Eric Zheng of the original simulator made by Adrian Thamburaj. The original simulation can be found <a href="https://adrian-thumbtack.github.io/woag-wiag-wiag/HungerGamesX">here</a>, and the source is available <a href="https://github.com/adrian-thumbtack/woag-wiag-wiag">here</a>. This new simulator is actually the result of Eric redoing the layout of the original simulator, keeping the underlying code written by Adrian.</p>
  <p>After this, Adrian released two more versions: (1) an incremental, mostly abandoned <a href="https://adrian-thumbtack.github.io/woag-wiag-wiag/HungerGamesII">version</a> incorporating a few of the stylistic changes that Eric made, and (2) a more complete redesign based on Eric's fork. The latest official release of the simulator can be found <a href="https://adrian-thumbtack.github.io/HungerGames/index">here</a>, and the source is available <a href="https://github.com/adrian-thumbtack/HungerGames">here</a>.</p>
